                                <p>Investing in businesses is about picking businesses that you believe have the
                                    potential to grow. You invest in exchange for a portion of their equity, meaning
                                    that you buy shares (or other equity-like interests) in the business. If a business
                                    you've invested in succeeds, the shares that you own will become worth more than you
                                    paid for them. However, if the business fails - as the majority of early-stage
                                    businesses do - you'll lose your investment.</p></p></li>

                                <p>

                                <p>One of the key reports we use to support the proposition that investing in businesses
                                    can be profitable comes from a major study on angel investing,
                                    <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/documents/Report%2021%20-%20Business%20Angel%20Inv%20v11.pdf" target="_blank">Siding

                                    in 2009. To our knowledge, this report is the most comprehensive study of returns

                                <h3>Will investing in businesses continue to be as profitable in the future?</h3>

                                <p>

                                <p>No one can say for sure, but we predict that it will become even more profitable,
                                    especially relative to other asset classes.</p>

                                <p>In a world where the creation of value is increasingly driven by innovation and
                                    adaptability rather than scale, businesses that are small and agile are
                                    well-positioned to outperform their bigger, slower counterparts. There will continue
                                    to be many failures of course, but we think that there will be more, and larger,
                                    successes, which in turn will mean that increasingly outsized returns will be
                                    available to investors in early-stage companies.</p></p></li>

                                need to raise investment?</h3>

                                <p>

                                <p>When an entrepreneur starts a new venture, they usually need money to turn the idea
                                    into the beginnings of an actual business that can reach out to customers and
                                    later-stage investors. Depending on the business, this capital might allow them to
                                    build a minimum viable product (technology startups), buy equipment (manufacturing
                                    startups), lease space and acquire inventory (retailing startups), hire a great
                                    team, expand their market and customer acquisition efforts, and so forth.</p>

                                <p>

                                <p>Each business decides how much money it wants to raise in exchange for a certain
                                    percentage of its equity, and each investor’s equity interest will be proportionate
                                    to the size of their investment. So if a campaign raises £150,000 in exchange for
                                    20% of its equity, and you invest £1,500 (1% of £150,000), you will receive 0.20%
                                    (1% of 20%) of the equity of the business.</p></p></li>

                                <p>No. Angel networks introduce investors and entrepreneurs but tend not to get closely
                                    involved in the investment process - it’s up to each investor and each entrepreneur
                                    to negotiate a deal individually and get lawyers to draft up the necessary
                                    contracts. Seedrs is a full investment platform, allowing investors to invest in
                                    businesses directly through the platform. Many angels choose to invest through
                                    Seedrs because of the increased efficiency and access to deal flow.</p></p></li>

                                <p>

                                <p>No. When investors invest in a business through Seedrs, they invest solely in the
                                    single campaign that they’ve chosen. However, we occasionally make available
                                    campaigns for individual 'funds' looking to raise investment for a pool of known or
                                    to-be-selected businesses (for an accelerator cohort, for example).</p></p></li>
                            <li id="is-seedrs-like-peer-to-peer-lending" class="faq-answer"><h3>Is Seedrs like
                                peer-to-peer lending?</h3>

                                <p>

                                <p>There are similarities but also important differences. The concept of having many
                                    people provide finance in small quantities via the internet was pioneered by peer-
                                    to-peer lending platforms like Zopa, Funding Circle and Kiva, and our founders were
                                    inspired by those models when creating Seedrs.</p>

                                <p>However, there are two major distinctions between peer-to-peer lending and Seedrs.
                                    First, Seedrs is generally about early- and growth-stage finance –for businesses,
                                    whereas most peer-to-peer lending sites focus on personal finance or later-stage
                                    businesses. And second, Seedrs is about equity investment rather than debt, which
                                    means that investors who use Seedrs can achieve much higher returns than they would
                                    in peer-to-peer lending, but they also bear the risks of the business and won't get
                                    their original investment back if the business fails.</p></p></li>

                                    with a potential for financial return: they usually rely on altruistic giving or
                                    non-monetary rewards. Seedrs allows people to back businesses by crowd investing,
                                    rather than donating, and therefore receive genuine financial returns when their
                                    investments are successful.</p></p></li>

                                <p>

                                <p>No. As an equity investor, investor liability will be limited to the amount invested,
                                    which means that even though they might not get their investment back, they can't be
                                    called on to pay anything more no matter what happens to the business.</p></p></li>

                                <p>

                                <p>There are three key risks when investing in an early-stage company. The main risk is
                                    simply that the business could fail, and investors won't get any money back. And
                                    even if the business succeeds, investments are likely to be illiquid for a
                                    substantial period of time - often a number of years - meaning that investors are
                                    unlikely to be able to sell the investment and will likely not receive dividends
                                    from it either. Finally, there is the risk of dilution: if the startup raises more
                                    capital later on (which most successful businesses need to do), the percentage of
                                    equity that existing investors hold in it will decrease relative to what they
                                    originally had. See our
                                    <a href="http://www.seedrs.com/risk_warning" target="_blank">Risk Warning</a> for

                                <p>

                                <p>Absolutely not. We strongly suggest that investors invest most of their capital in
                                    safer, more liquid assets, such as mutual funds, bonds and bank deposits. As a rule
                                    of thumb, active angel investors tend to invest no more than between 5% and 15% of
                                    their capital in early-stage businesses. Whatever proportion of money users choose
                                    to invest, the most important thing is that they can afford to lose all of

                                <p>We think that the better practice is to diversify by investing small amounts in
                                    multiple businesses. Because the distribution of returns from early – stage
                                    businesses is highly skewed - meaning that the majority of startups fail, and most
                                    of the profits come from a few big successes - investors are more likely to make a
                                    profit by investing in a number of businesses in the hopes that the successes of a
                                    few outweigh the losses of the rest.</p></p></li>

                                <p>After a campaign has reached 100% of its funding target, entrepreneurs have the
                                    option of raising more than their target investment amount if the demand is there
                                    from investors. We call this "overfunding".</p>

                                <p>We operate an all-or-nothing model where entrepreneurs must reach their minimum
                                    target or investors get their funds back. But if a campaign goes into overfunding,
                                    the entrepreneur will be able to accept any amount from 100% and up during the
                                    remaining duration of their campaign (in exchange for a corresponding amount of
                                    additional equity). Entrepreneurs are not required to take investment but reserve
                                    the right to accept any amount beyond 100%.</p></p></li>

                                <p>No. Once all the money has been invested, we conduct a legal due diligence process
                                    and negotiate a legal agreement with the business on behalf of investors before the

                                <p>To make investments, you need to successfully complete our Investor Questionnaire, or
                                    self-certify as a "high net worth individual" or a "sophisticated investor" (or, if
                                    you are an institution, a “high net worth company, unincorporated association,
                                    etc”). This is necessary to show us that that you have the professional judgment and
                                    understanding to appreciate the risks and considerations of investing in early-stage
                                    businesses as an asset class.</p></p></li>

                                <p>Like all financial services businesses, we are required by anti-money laundering
                                    regulations to verify the identities of our investors. You’ll need to pass this
                                    process before you can make a deposit into your Seedrs account:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Automatic: Often we can verify your identity automatically when you enter your
                                        personal details on the platform before you make a deposit by using a third
                                        party online database. But sometimes we are unable to verify your identity this
                                        way. This is nothing to worry about and can happen for a number of reasons, for
                                        example if you have recently moved house, if the database does not cover the
                                        place where you live, or a simple data entry error.

                                    <li>Document: If we can't identify you using the automatic process, then we will
                                        need to verify your identity using documents as evidence of your identity and
                                        address. You will be asked to upload copies of the following two documents
                                        through the platform (which can be scans or photos taken on your mobile phone):

                                <p>The information that you send us will be used solely to verify your identity and will
                                    not be used for any other purposes. Please note that we require two separate
                                    documents (even if your government issued photo ID also states your address). Once
                                    we have reviewed these documents we will let you know whether you have cleared the

                                    your Seedrs account. However, you can still make investments on the platform before
                                    then but you won’t be able to pay for (and so complete) such investments until
                                    identity verification has been completed.</p></p></li>

                                <p>Users purchase ordinary shares in a business. These are the same type of shares that
                                    the founders and other early investors will usually have. We then hold those shares
                                    for them as their nominee: this is a common way of holding shares on behalf of large
                                    numbers of investors and makes it possible for us to take care of the administrative
                                    work involved in being a shareholder.</p>

                                <p>This structure means that all investors are given the opportunity to vote and receive

                                <p>Us. We have a number of measures in place – including conducting upfront checks,
                                    holding entrepreneurs and businesses accountable for the information they have
                                    provided us, and, if necessary taking legal action against the entrepreneurs and
                                    business for non-compliance with the subscription agreement – to ensure that the
                                    investment monies are used for genuine business purposes.</p>

                                <p>Entrepreneurs may make bad business choices, and that's a risk investors bear, but if
                                    any entrepreneur tries to act dishonestly we will investigate and, if appropriate,
                                    pursue legal action against them. That said, we believe that 99.9% of entrepreneurs
                                    are well-intentioned people trying to create great businesses, and we expect only to
                                    have to use these measures on rare occasion.</p></p></li>

                                <p>After an investment is made through Seedrs, there is a period of time between when
                                    funds are committed and when we complete the investment in the company. This is
                                    because we only complete an investment after the business has reached 100% of its
                                    funding target and we have finished our legal due diligence process.</p>

                                <p>For tax purposes, investments will be deemed to have been made when we complete the
                                    investment into the company, not when funds are committed through Seedrs. We
                                    appreciate that this can cause some uncertainty for tax planning purposes, but
                                    because we do not know how long it will take a given business to reach its funding
                                    target and finish due diligence, we cannot predict exactly when we will be able to
                                    complete an investment in it.</p></p></li>

                                    investor questionnaire, they will be categorised as follows:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Self-Certified Sophisticated Investors. Some of our investors self-certify that
                                        they meet the requirements of a "sophisticated investor", which are set out in
                                        law. These investors are categorised by us as "retail clients/sophisticated
                                        investors", meaning that they are afforded the rights and protections the FCA
                                        grants to retail clients/sophisticated investors.
                                    </li>

                                        self-certification are set out in law. These investors are categorised by us as
                                        "retail clients/high-net-worth individuals", and they are in the same position
                                        as Self-Certified Sophisticated Investors for purposes of FCA rights and
                                        protections.

                                        categorised by us as "professional clients/Category 7 persons". These investors
                                        are afforded the same rights and protections by us as are retail clients, but
                                        they do not receive the same rights from the FCA. The primary difference is that
                                        these investors will be treated differently to retail clients if they complain
                                        to the Financial Ombudsman Service or claim compensation under the Financial

                                    on a stock exchange – also called an exit event. It takes time for businesses to
                                    grow to the point of exit; it may take several years for this to occur. In addition,

                                    wound up or sold for a nominal price, while in other cases the business won't
                                    formally shut down but we'll write off the investment and dispose of the shares. Any
                                    proceeds from these processes will be distributed to investors, but they're likely
                                    to represent far less than the original investment, and there may not be any
                                    proceeds at all.</p></p></li>

                                need Seedrs to be able to invest?</h3>

                                <p>

                                <p>Unless they're extremely wealthy and have lots of time on their hands, it is very
                                    difficult for most people to invest in early-stage businesses the traditional way as
                                    a business angel. Due to transaction costs and other considerations, most angels
                                    find they need to invest at least £10,000 per business; and because this is a
                                    high-risk type of investing, many angels try to invest in at least 10 and often
                                    more. This means that to be an angel, people generally need to have £100,000 or more
                                    to allocate just to businesses (which means that they need to have far more than
                                    £100,000 in order to build a diversified portfolio that includes safer assets), and
                                    they also need to have the time to find, negotiate and execute a large number of
                                    offline investments.</p>

                                <p>Investors with that much money and time available might not need Seedrs (although we
                                    can still provide them with access to investment opportunities they might not
                                    otherwise find, and more efficient investing). For everyone else, though, Seedrs
                                    provides the chance to invest small amounts of money through a streamlined, online
                                    process, which means that we're the one way to participate in the benefits of
                                    investing in early-stage businesses without having both a fortune and tons of time
                                    to spare.</p></p></li>

                                safe?</h3>

                                <p>No. The equity of an early-stage business is considered a high risk investment, and
                                    in most cases money will not be returned to investors. The goal with this type of
                                    investing is to invest in one or several businesses that perform so well that they
                                    more than compensate for the ones that don't work out. But as there's no guarantee
                                    that investors will pick one of the big winners, investors should only invest money
                                    they can afford to lose.</p></p></li>

                                        Seedrs will not face problems with a large cap table when raising later-stage
                                        funding from VCs or others. In the absence of our nominee approach, the

                                        investor could make it nearly impossible to raise further finance; under the

                                <p>No. As an equity investor, investor liability will be limited to the amount invested,
                                    which means that even though they might not get their investment back, they can't be

                                <p>No. Companies issue shares to us as nominee of the investors. This is a common way of
                                    holding shares on behalf of large numbers of investors, and it means that we are the

                                <p>We act as the nominee shareholder on behalf of each investor on Seedrs. This means
                                    that:</p>

                                    <li>Investors do not need to worry about managing their investments. We ensure that
                                        their investments are protected using both the statutory provisions afforded to
                                        shareholders as well as the professional, investor grade, contractual
                                        protections that are in place under our subscription agreement with each
                                        company.

                                    <li>The companies do not have to worry about having to manage numerous individual
                                        investors. We have the power to take votes and issue consents on behalf of each
                                        Seedrs investor, which results in an efficient and streamlined process for
                                        everyone. This also means that a company that has raised investment through
                                        Seedrs will not face problems with a large cap table when raising later-stage
                                        funding from VCs or others. In the absence of our nominee approach, the
                                        difficulty in obtaining consents and other signatures from each individual
                                        investor could make it nearly impossible to raise further finance; under the
                                        Seedrs structure, we take care of those consents and signatures the same way as
                                        a single institutional investor would.

                                <p>

                                <p>When an entrepreneur starts a new venture, they usually need money to turn the idea
                                    into the beginnings of an actual business that can reach out to customers and
                                    later-stage investors. Depending on the business, this capital might allow them to
                                    build a minimum viable product (technology startups), buy equipment (manufacturing
                                    startups), lease space and acquire inventory (retailing startups), hire a great
                                    team, expand their market and customer acquisition efforts, and so forth.</p>

                                <p>

                                <p>Each business decides how much money it wants to raise in exchange for a certain
                                    percentage of its equity, and each investor’s equity interest will be proportionate
                                    to the size of their investment. So if a campaign raises £150,000 in exchange for
                                    20% of its equity, and you invest £1,500 (1% of £150,000), you will receive 0.20%
                                    (1% of 20%) of the equity of the business.</p></p></li>

                                <p>No. Angel networks introduce investors and entrepreneurs but tend not to get closely
                                    involved in the investment process - it’s up to each investor and each entrepreneur
                                    to negotiate a deal individually and get lawyers to draft up the necessary
                                    contracts. Seedrs is a full investment platform, allowing investors to invest in
                                    businesses directly through the platform. Many angels choose to invest through
                                    Seedrs because of the increased efficiency and access to deal flow.</p></p></li>

                                peer-to-peer lending?</h3>

                                <p>

                                <p>There are similarities but also important differences. The concept of having many
                                    people provide finance in small quantities via the internet was pioneered by peer-
                                    to-peer lending platforms like Zopa, Funding Circle and Kiva, and our founders were
                                    inspired by those models when creating Seedrs.</p>

                                <p>However, there are two major distinctions between peer-to-peer lending and Seedrs.
                                    First, Seedrs is generally about early- and growth-stage finance –for businesses,
                                    whereas most peer-to-peer lending sites focus on personal finance or later-stage
                                    businesses. And second, Seedrs is about equity investment rather than debt, which
                                    means that investors who use Seedrs can achieve much higher returns than they would
                                    in peer-to-peer lending, but they also bear the risks of the business and won't get
                                    their original investment back if the business fails.</p></p></li>
                            <li id="is-seedrs-a-form-of-crowdfunding" class="faq-answer"><h3>Is Seedrs a form of
                                crowdfunding?</h3>

                                <p>

                                <p>Yes. Crowdfunding is a broad term that has come to be used for a wide-range of
                                    financing techniques, including charitable and political donations, art patronage
                                    and entrepreneurial finance. Most forms of crowdfunding have not provided funders
                                    with a potential for financial return: they usually rely on altruistic giving or
                                    non-monetary rewards. Seedrs allows people to back businesses by crowd investing,
                                    rather than donating, and therefore receive genuine financial returns when their
                                    investments are successful.</p></p></li>
                            <li id="should-a-business-raise-debt-or-equity" class="faq-answer"><h3>Should a business
                                raise debt or equity?</h3>

                                <p>

                                <p>We think that equity is a much better option than debt for growth-focused businesses,
                                    because equity creates a greater alignment of interests between the investors and
                                    the entrepreneur.</p>

                                <p>Early-stage businesses, by their nature, tend to involve a lot of risk and a high
                                    likelihood of failure. If a business raises debt capital and it doesn't work out,
                                    the lender can still insist on being repaid - which in many cases means that the
                                    business has to pay them back personally or else declare bankruptcy. And even if the
                                    business goes well, lenders usually want to be repaid very quickly, so the
                                    entrepreneur is forced to take cash out of the business that could be used to
                                    grow.</p>

                                <p>In contrast, raising equity capital allows businesses and their investors to share
                                    the risk of the business, so founders don't end up personally ruined if the business
                                    fails, and it's in the investors’ interest to see the business grow rather than pay
                                    out cash quickly. Once the business has grown and become less risky, it may be that
                                    debt is a useful option to finance expansion or working capital needs, but when
                                    raising growth capital we feel that equity is the way to go (that’s why we built a

                                <p>They can't, but confidentiality is the last thing a new business should be worrying
                                    about. Sharing their idea is critical to raising funds, attracting collaborators and
                                    building their product.</p>

                                <p>What about the risk that someone steals the idea in the process? Eric Ries provides a
                                    very clear answer to this in The Lean Startup:</p>

                                <p>"The most common objection I have heard over the years to building a minimum viable
                                    product is fear of competitors - especially large established companies - stealing a
                                    startup's idea. If only it were so easy to have a good idea stolen! Part of the
                                    special challenge of being a startup is the near impossibility of having your idea,
                                    company or product be noticed by anyone, let alone a competitor. In fact, I have
                                    often given entrepreneurs fearful of this issue the following assignment: take one
                                    of your ideas, find the name of the relevant product manager at an established
                                    company who has responsibility for that area, and try to get them to steal your
                                    idea. Call them up, write them a memo, send them a press release - go ahead, try it!
                                    The truth is that most managers in most companies are already overwhelmed with good
                                    ideas. Their challenge lies in prioritization and execution, and it is those
                                    challenges that gives a startup hope of surviving. If a competitor can out-execute a
                                    startup once the idea is known, the startup is doomed anyway..."</p></p></li>

                                <p>

                                <p>The main downside to raising investment is that entrepreneurs have to give away
                                    equity in the business. This could mean sharing future potential profits with
                                    investors, instead of keeping it for themselves. This may occur when the business
                                    eventually seeks an exit opportunity, such as a sale of the company or flotation, or
                                    distributes some of their profits out in dividends. Most entrepreneurs are happy to
                                    accept this trade-off, as in practice it usually means that they get a slightly
                                    smaller piece of a much larger pie. But if founders are really determined to keep
                                    ownership of 100% of the business, then they should look for other ways to finance
                                    it.</p></p></li>

                                campaigns?</h3>

                                <p>

                                <p>After a campaign has reached 100% of its funding target, entrepreneurs have the
                                    option of raising more than their target investment amount if the demand is there
                                    from investors. We call this "overfunding".</p>

                                <p>We operate an all-or-nothing model where entrepreneurs must reach their minimum
                                    target or investors get their funds back. But if a campaign goes into overfunding,
                                    the entrepreneur will be able to accept any amount from 100% and up during the
                                    remaining duration of their campaign (in exchange for a corresponding amount of
                                    additional equity). Entrepreneurs are not required to take investment but reserve
                                    the right to accept any amount beyond 100%.</p></p></li>

                                <p>

                                <p>No. Once all the money has been invested, we conduct a legal due diligence process
                                    and negotiate a legal agreement with the business on behalf of investors before the
                                    investment is completed. If we identify problems in the legal due diligence process
                                    or are unable to agree legal terms, we'll cancel the investment and return funds
                                    back to investors, just as we would if the campaign had not received commitments for

                                <p>We charge businesses a fee of up to 7.5% of the money they successfully raise through
                                    Seedrs. This means that we do not charge businesses a fee to seek capital. We feel
                                    that so-called “pay-to-pitch” models deter many great entrepreneurs because they
                                    risk losing money even if they don’t get investment. Our fee model ensures that
                                    entrepreneurs only have to pay us if they raise money through us, and we think this
                                    is important to attracting high-potential businesses.</p></p></li>

                                <p>Seedrs is the easiest way for founders to access the capital of people who want to
                                    invest in businesses but do not have both the money and time to be traditional angel
                                    investors. This could include friends, family, customers and members of a business's
                                    community, along with other people across Europe who are interested in, and want to
                                    share in the success of, dynamic new businesses. Due to high transaction costs and
                                    other considerations, it is very difficult to raise capital from these people
                                    directly offline. Seedrs makes it a straightforward and simple process for companies
                                    to raise investment, as well as build engagement with, or reward, their
                                    community.</p></p></li>

                                <p>Accepting external investment into a company (from any source) always comes with

                                <p>So long as they retain over 50% of the business's equity, they will keep control of

                                    provided us, and, if necessary taking legal action against the entrepreneurs and
                                    business for non-compliance with the subscription agreement – to ensure that the

                                <p>Entrepreneurs may make bad business choices, and that's a risk investors bear, but if
                                    any entrepreneur tries to act dishonestly we will investigate and, if appropriate,
                                    pursue legal action against them. That said, we believe that 99.9% of entrepreneurs
                                    are well-intentioned people trying to create great businesses, and we expect only to
                                    have to use these measures on rare occasion.</p></p></li>

                                <p>This is more likely to happen than not. In some cases the business will either be

                                <p>We think that during the earliest stages of a business, it makes most sense for

                                    in place to protect the investors, but we won't ask for a board seat or otherwise

                                <p>Yes. The main form of mentorship and support comes from investors. We find that often
                                    the most useful thing for a business (other than capital) is connecting with the
                                    right specialist, and then deciding how and if they would like to work with them. By
                                    raising funds on Seedrs, businesses will be connected with hundreds, and potentially
                                    thousands, of people from a range of backgrounds, all of whom have a vested interest
                                    in the success of the business. Somewhere in that crowd there is likely to be
                                    someone who can help with what is needed, when it's needed (as well as lots of
                                    people who can test products and act as early-adopters and mavens). Additionally, we

                                <p>They shouldn't, because we act as the sole legal shareholder. Venture capitalists and
                                    other later-stage investors often don't like to invest in businesses with lots of
                                    geographically-scattered small shareholders in their cap table, as it can make the
                                    logistics of investing - and exiting - very complicated. But in the case of a
                                    Seedrs-funded business, there will just be one legal shareholder, us, who can sign
                                    documents and handle other logistics quickly and effectively, and that is the ideal
                                    scenario from most later-stage investors' point of view. Moreover, the fact that a
                                    business has so many investors that have demonstrated their support is likely to be
                                    very appealing to later-stage investors.</p>

                                campaign reaches 100%?</h3>

                                <p>

                                <p>If a campaign receives 100% of the investment it is seeking within the campaign
                                    period, we perform detailed due diligence on the business, the company and the
                                    directors. This includes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Helping the entrepreneur set up the company if it has not already been
                                        incorporated or needs to create a UK structure,
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Assisting with all EIS or SEIS advanced assurance paperwork,</li>
                                    <li>Sending the entrepreneur a typical early-stage investment due diligence request
                                        list, requesting that they send us any contracts, paperwork or other information
                                        with respect to general corporate matters, shareholders, financials (including
                                        debt), commercial contracts, property, intellectual property and related
                                        matters, all of which we review, and
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Interviewing directors, if we deem it necessary.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Once we have completed legal due diligence, our investment team prepares the relevant
                                    legal documentation required to complete the round of financing raised on Seedrs.
                                    This includes the execution of our standard form subscription agreement and the
                                    adoption of our standard form articles of association, in each case modified as
                                    necessary to reflect any relevant circumstances. We also ensure that any
                                    intellectual property owned by individuals is transferred into the company’s name,
                                    and any outstanding director loans are dealt with in an appropriate way before
                                    closing.</p>

                                <p>And when we are happy that everything is in order, we transfer the funds to the
                                    company, less our fee. If any material problems arise during the due diligence
                                    process, if we discover anything which we believe would result in the completion of
                                    the deal not being in the interests of the investors or if the company is not
                                    willing to adopt our articles or sign our subscription agreement, then we will
                                    cancel the deal and return investors' investment funds.</p></p></li>
