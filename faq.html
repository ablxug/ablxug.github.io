                <h4>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:</h4>
                <h5>What funding model does ABLX follow?</h5>
                <p>Keep it All (KiA) - No matter whether the project goal is met or not, all of the funds collected (minus commission) are handed over to the entrepreneur. If he or she has insufficient funds to meet the objectives, then it is up to the recipient to refund them to the contributors. </p>

                <h5>What are the other benefits of investing in start-ups?</h5>
                <p>Beyond the potential profits, investors can enjoy two additional benefits from investing in start-ups. First, it's a chance to be a part of the next big thing - to be like the dragons on BBC2's Dragon's Den and pick exciting businesses, follow their progress as they grow and get credit and recognition for having been one of the first people to spot them. Second, you get to contribute to the culture of innovation by supporting entrepreneurs when they need it most and giving them a chance to get great new businesses off the ground. For many people neither of these is as important as the financial returns, but at the very least they can be nice add-ons.</p>

                <h5>Why do start-ups need my money?</h5>
                <p>When an entrepreneur starts a new venture, he or she usually needs a little bit of money to turn the idea into the beginnings of an actual business that can reach out to customers and later-stage investors. Depending on the business, this money - known as seed capital - might allow the entrepreneur to build a minimum viable product (technology start-ups), buy equipment (manufacturing start-ups), lease space and acquire inventory (retailing start-ups) and so forth. Every startup is different, but as the costs of starting a business have come down drastically due to the Internet and other technological innovations, an increasing number of entrepreneurs find that a little bit of seed capital - USD 150,000 or less - can get them a long way </p>

                <h4>Making Investments Through ABLX</h4>

                <h5>How do I use ABLX to invest in start-ups?</h5>
                <p>ABLX allows you to learn about start-ups that are looking for capital, make investments in the ones you like and watch as the businesses you've invested in grow, all directly through the website. Whenever there is a return on your investment - such as when the business pays a dividend, floats on a stock exchange or is bought by another company - the money will get paid directly to you. </p>

                <h5>Does ABLX vet the start-ups that are seeking capital through the platform?</h5>

                <p>Yes. We review all of the information that a startup provides, as well as evidence it submits to support factual statements, and we only post the startup for investors to  see if we conclude that the information is fair, clear and not misleading. </p>

                <h5>Will ABLX advise me which start-ups to invest in?</h5>

                <p>No. While we confirm and approve all the information provided by each startup, we generally do not make our own judgement about whether it's a good business. We believe that when it comes to start-ups, a large number of small investors are better suited to assess the business’s prospects than a few professional managers. That said, we do our best to exclude businesses that are proposing to do something illegal, unethical or just downright stupid. </p>

                <h5>How much equity will I receive for my investment?</h5>
                <p>Each startup decides how much money it wants to raise in exchange for what percentage of its equity, and your equity interest will be proportionate to the size of your investment. So, if a startup is seeking $50,000 in exchange for 20% of it's equity, and you invest $500 (1% of £50,000), you will receive 0.20% (1% of 20%) of the startup's equity. </p>

                <h5>How do I transfer the money to make an investment?</h5>
                <p>Contact the ABLX support: info@ablexchange.com </p>

                <h5>Once a startup has received all the money it's seeking, will the investment definitely be completed?</h5>
                <p>No. Once all the money has been invested, we conduct a legal due diligence process and negotiate a legal agreement with the startup before the investment is completed. If we identify problems in the legal due diligence process or are unable to agree legal terms, we'll cancel the investment and credit all of your money back to you, just as we would if the startup had not received commitments for all of the money it was seeking.</p>

                <h5>What legal protections will I have as an investor?</h5>
                <p>As your nominee, we will enter into a subscription agreement with the startup before completing the investment. This agreement, which is very similar to the type of agreement that business angels and venture capitalists enter when they invest in start-ups, provides you (and us) with a number of rights and protections. While each subscription agreement may be slightly different, it will generally include provisions such as a requirement that the company provide information to investors on a regular basis (known as “information covenants”), a requirement that if the company is sold the investors are able to sell their interests alongside the founder. </p>

                <h4>Post-Investment Process</h4>

                <h5>Do I need to manage the investment once I have made it?</h5>
                <p>No. We manage the investment as your nominee, including signing documents, casting shareholder votes and dealing with the various other administrative requirements of being a legal shareholder. However, we'll keep you up to date on how the business is doing, and you can check the "My Investments" section of the website to read updates from management, media links and other information. </p>

                <h5>Can I stay involved with the startup after I’ve invested?</h5>
                <p>Absolutely. In addition to watching the business’s progress through the “Your Investments” section of the website, you’re welcome to reach out to the business to offer support, advice or mentorship at anytime. One of the biggest benefits to a startup in using ABLX to raise capital is that it can tap the expertise and wisdom of its large base of investors. </p>

                <h5>How will the startup use my investment?</h5>
                <p>In the information you see about each startup before you decide whether to invest, the business may disclose what they intend to use the investment for. But start-ups need to be flexible, and if it turns out that they find a better way to use the money to grow their business, they can do so. </p>

                <h5>How do I make money off my investment?</h5>
                <p>The main way you can make money of your investment is if you sell your shares. This is most likely to happen if the business is bought by another company or floats on a stock exchange. However, if you are able to find a private buyer (and that person is or becomes a ABLX member), you are welcome to sell your shares to him or her on whatever terms you agree. In addition, you will receive any dividend the startup pays on your shares. </p>

                <h5>How will you distribute this money to me?</h5>
                <p>Email info@ablexchange.com</p>

                <h5>What happens if the startup I invest in fails?</h5>
                <p>In some cases the startup will either be wound up or sold for a nominal price, while in other cases the business won't formally shut down but we'll write off the investment and dispose of the shares.Any proceeds from these processes will be distributed to you (just as if the shares of a successful startup had been sold), but they're likely to represent far less than your original investment, and there may not be any proceeds. </p>

                <h4>Risks to Investors</h4>
                <h5>Are start-ups a safe investment?</h5>
                <p>No. The equity of a startup is considered a high risk investment, and in most cases none of your money will be returned. The goal with this type of investing is to invest in one or several start-ups that perform so well that they more than compensate for the ones that don't work out. But as there's no guarantee that you'll pick one of the big winners, you should only invest money you can afford to lose. </p>

                <h5>Is there a chance I could lose more than I invested?</h5>
                <p>None whatsoever.As an equity investor, your liability will be limited to the amount you invested, which means that even though you might not get your investment back, you can't be called on to pay anything more no matter what happens to the business.</p>

                <h5>What are the main risks of investing in start-ups?</h5>
                <p>There are three key risks when investing in a startup. The first is simply that the business will fail, and you won't get any of your money back. But even if the business succeeds, your investment is likely to be illiquid for a substantial period of time - often a number of years - meaning that you are unlikely to be able to sell the investment, and you probably will not receive dividends from it either. Finally, there is the risk of dilution, if the startup raises more capital later on (which most successful start-ups need to do), the percentage of equity you hold in it will decrease relative to what you originally had. </p>

                <h5>Should I invest all of my money in start-ups?</h5>
                <p>Absolutely not. We strongly recommend that you invest most of your capital in safer, more liquid assets, such as mutual funds, bonds and bank deposits. As a rule of thumb, active angel investors tend to invest no more than between 5% and 15% of their capital in start-ups, and we limit you to investing a maximum 20% of your declared net assets in aggregate through ABLX. Whatever proportion of your money you choose to invest, the most important thing is that you can afford to lose all of it. </p>

                <h5>Of the money I invest in start-ups, should I invest most of it in one business or small amounts in multiple businesses?</h5>

                <p>We think that the better practice is to invest small amounts in multiple start-ups. Because the distribution of returns from start-ups is highly skewed - meaning that the majority of start-ups fail, and most of the profits come from a few big successes - you are more likely to make a profit by investing in a number of start-ups in the hopes that the successes of a few outweigh the losses of the rest. </p>

                <h4>Raising Capital for Start-ups </h4>

                <h5>Why might I need capital for my startup?</h5>
                <p>Many entrepreneurs need just a little bit of money to turn their idea into the beginnings of an actual business that can reach out to customers and later-stage investors. Depending on the business, this money - known as seed capital - might allow you to build a minimum viable product if you're a technology startup, buy equipment if you're a manufacturing startup, lease space and acquire inventory if you're a retailing startup, and so forth. Every startup is different, but as the costs of starting a business have come down drastically due to the Internet and other technological innovations, an increasing number of entrepreneurs find that a little bit of seed capital.  </p>

                <h5>What kind of seed capital can an entrepreneur raise?</h5>
                <p>Equity only, from a single source or multiple sources (including crowd funding)</p>

                <h5>Who can I raise equity seed capital from?</h5>
                <p>Some entrepreneurs start with lots of spare savings or the proverbial rich uncle, but for those who don't your options are actually pretty limited. Venture capitalists are the main institutional investors in early-stage businesses, but only a very few of them invest true seed capital: most want to see some progress in the business first, so when you're still at seed-stage they're off-limits. </p>
                <p>Sometimes entrepreneurs get stuck in a paradox, where they can't raise money to build their business but they can't build their business without money, and it's because of this that many great entrepreneurial ideas never get off the ground. That's where ablx comes in.</p>

                <h5>Will ABLX vet my startup before I can seek capital?</h5>
                <p>Yes. We review all of the information that you provide when you create your listing, and we ask you to submit evidence to support factual statements. We will only post the listing for investors to see if we conclude that the information you've provided is fair, clear and not misleading (and even then, we won't post the listing if we think you're doing something illegal or unethical </p>

                <h5>Will ABLX advise investors to invest in my startup?</h5>

                <p>No. While we confirm and approve all the information provided by each startup, we do not make our own judgement about whether it's a good business. We believe that when it comes to start-ups, a large number of small investors are better suited to assess the business’s prospects than a few professional managers.</p>

                <h5>How much equity should I offer exchange for the investment?</h5>
                <p>You get to decide how much equity you want to offer, and investors can take it or leave it.</p>

                <h5> How can I protect the confidentiality of the my idea?</h5>
                <p>You can't, but confidentiality is the last thing a new startup should be worrying about. Sharing your idea is critical to raising funds, attracting collaborators and building your product.</p>

                <h5> Once I've received all the money I'm seeking, will the investment in my startup definitely be completed?</h5>
                <p>No. Once all the money has been invested, we need to conduct a legal due diligence process on the business and enter into a subscription agreement with you before the investment is completed. In most cases this should be a quick and painless process, and once it's done we'll transfer you the money in exchange for your shares. If we identify problems in the legal due diligence process or are unable to agree legal terms, the process may get drawn out, and ultimately. </p>

                <h4>Legal Structure</h4>

                <h5>What type of equity will my startup need to issue? </h5>
                <p>The startup will be asked to issue ordinary shares. These are the same type of shares that you, your co-founders and other early investors will usually have.</p>

                <h5>Will my startup issue the shares directly to the investors?</h5>
                <p>No. You will issue the shares to us as nominee of the investors. This is a common way of holding shares on behalf of large numbers of investors.</p>


                <h4>Post-Fundraising Process</h4>

                <h5>In addition to capital, I need mentorship and support for my startup. Does ABLX provide this?</h5>
                <p>Yes. The main form of mentorship and support you will get will be from your investors. We find that often the most useful thing for a startup (other than capital) is connecting with the right specialist, and then you can decide how and whether you want to work with him or her. Having several hundred people from a range of backgrounds, all of whom have a vested interest in the success of your business, is likely to be very valuable to you – and somewhere in that crowd there is likely to be someone who can help you with what you need when you need it (as well as lots of people who can test your product and act as early-adopters and mavens). Additionally, we will be very happy to introduce you to our extensive network of mentors, advisers, vendors and later-stage investors. </p>

                <h5>Will you keep the investors informed about how my business is progressing?</h5>
                <p>Yes. We'll pass along to the investors updates you send us, media links and other information, all of which they'll be able to access all this information through the "My Investments" section of the website. </p>

                <h5>What will my startup be allowed use the money we raise for?</h5>
                <p>When you create your listing, you'll be given the opportunity to disclose what you intend to use the investment for. But we recognise that start-ups need to be flexible, and if it turns out that you find a better way to use the money to grow your business, you'll be largely free to do so. </p>

                <h5>How do investors make money off their investment?</h5>
                <p>The main way investors can make money of their investment is if they sell the shares they own. This is most likely to happen if your business is bought by another company or floats on a stock exchange. The investor may also sell his or her shares to a private buyer, but that buyer will need to be (or become) a ABLX member and enter into a nominee arrangement with us, just as the initial investor did. In addition, investors will receive any dividend your startup pays on his or her shares.</p>

                <p>ABLX are the sole legal shareholder for you to deal with on administrative matters, such as casting votes and issuing consents.</p>


                <h4>Risks to Entrepreneurs</h4>
                <h5>What is the downside to raising equity capital through ABLX?</h5>
                <p>Anytime you raise equity capital, including through ABLX, the one drawback is that if your business is successful you'll need to share some of that success with your investors. This may mean seeking an exit opportunity, such as a sale of the company or flotation, at some point, or else it could mean paying some of your profits out in dividends. Most entrepreneurs are happy to accept this trade-off, as in practice it usually means that they get a slightly smaller piece of a much larger pie. But if you're really determined to keep ownership of 100% of your business, then you should look for other ways to finance it.</p>

                <h5>If my startup fails, is there any chance I can be personally liable to the investors?</h5>
                <p>Not so long as you act honestly and put genuine efforts into the business. Equity investment is about risk-sharing, so if you try to make the business succeed and it just doesn't work out, everyone simply walks away. However, if you use the investment you receive dishonestly or simply spend the money down without actually trying to make the business work, that's a different story - on behalf of the investors, we will seek damages from you personally, and if we believe your behaviour amounts to fraud, we will consider pressing criminal charges. So, assuming you're among the 99.9% of entrepreneurs who we believe are well-intentioned people trying to create great businesses, you have nothing to worry about, but if you're thinking about pulling a scam or just not bothering to work on your business, then for your own sake we'd suggest that you not use ABLX</p>
